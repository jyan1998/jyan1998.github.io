## About the Book

Apprenticeship Patterns is a book written for software developers to grow professionally in different aspects.

I am primarily looking to extract learning techniques from this book.



## Key Takeaways
* Confront your ignorance by exposing it to the world and ensuring you take actions to overcome it. Tackle the issue one step at a time in a way effective for yourself

* Find individuals similar to yourself, and learn from each other. They can be a mentor, or fellow apprentice.

* Self feedback is based on your past abilities, while others feedback is objective. Thus seek feedback from others.

* Turn feedback into actionable information, and act upon them.

* Be careful not to practice bad habits.

* Practice needs to be playful and stress free.

* xperience and skill is built upon failure more than success. However, we are often not in situations where we are allowed to fail, so seek opportunities like self projects which give us freedom to fail. Remember to do what interests you so you can stay motivated.

* Reflect as you work. Break down your actions and the connections between them, and the pleasant and unpleasant. Then find ways to fix or improve the negatives.

* Record what you learn, so you have a backup in case you forget the details.


## Summary

An additional overarching concept that this book also attempts to teach is the idea of patterns. Although not explicitly stated (or perhaps I missed it), we are told to frequently use these patterns of learning techniques. In simpler terms, it is to build a habit.

By building a habit of these learning techniques is when we will experience a significant boost in effective learning, and this is my first step towards this - by recording what I learn.

## Extracts from the book.
Reworded and simplified for my reading.



### Confronting Ignorance

Confronting your ignorance is the first step to overcoming it. So when you find techniques or aspects you need to improve on, but don't know how, tackle things one at a time in whatever method is effective for YOU. Ask others for help, as they may be in the same boat and learning together is still very effective.

Of course, while being willing to expose your ignorance, it is important to remember to confront it. Those who merely expose become overly dependent on others. 



### Deep End

While doing this and tackling techniques one at a time, you may feel that these small steps are unsatisfying and you wish to tackle a larger project.

In these scenarios, jump in the deep end. Waiting until you are ready can result in never doing anything. However, do not ignore the risks that come with these leap of faiths, but face them directly and prepare for them.

If you find yourself 'drowning', make sure to seek others for help and look at your feedback loop which should include external voices. This is because self feedback compares the abilities you used to have, which often lacks objectivity.

The teams you work in can skew your sense of competence. On an above-average team, you may feel like a superstar when you're really a backup singer, or the other way around. A similar situation occurs when you're on a below average team. So ask people. Consistently seek OBJECTIVE feedback to learn more about yourself. Turn this data into something ACTIONABLE, and act upon it.

In addition to this, be aware that feedback can reinforce and balance behavior (do more/less of something), and we can stay stable by making many small adjustments. 

While receiving advice or feedback, avoid defending your current level of knowledge, except become more teachable so your pool of potential teachers expand.

Despite all this, you will still experience failures. Seek the way or behaviors which lead to your failures and fix those worth fixing. The goal isn't to become perfect, but to improve. Accept that you may not be good at everything and cut your losses when there is a disproportionate investment of time and effort.



### The Journey

When you devote your entire career to a craft, it becomes rather realistic than vain to think of over taking those who inspired you.

However, its inevitable to be in a job where you must balance your craft and delivering solutions. Focus on delivering to your customers before advancing your self interests, after all, a craftsman builds something to serve others.

Throughout all this, you'll find days where your motivation is dropping low, and you question your commitment.

A way to help stay on the journey is to write 15 things that motivate you, wait a while and write another 5. Write a list of the 5 things that most motivate you and look at it when times get tough.

Along this journey, you may not have a mentor. Find yourself people on a similar road as you and use this opportunity to learn from each other but be aware of group think. You can identify a communities health by the way they react to new ideas, do they test it or do they straight reject it. 



### Learning Bandwidth

There are times which you will be drinking information steadily through a straw, but there are seasons in apprenticeship when one must drink from a fire hose of information.

Expand the sources of information you can obtain from, whether that be books, communities, projects, research. Also make sure to return to the craft, rather than getting lost in the sea of information, and although this pattern will accelerate your learning, it will slow down your development if applied for long periods of time.



### Practice

Many of us have been told that practice makes perfect, but in reality practice make permanent. This is why we must be careful what we practice, to ensure we are not enforcing bad habits and to carefully choose what we practice. 

Additionally, we should know that practice isn't to hone memory, but rather to become familiar with the nuances in even the simplest activities.
Throughout all this practice, feedback loops will ensure both objectivity and integrity of our practice.

If we are not blessed with another craftsman or master in our life for feedback, we should seek out the source. In software engineering, this may be reading others code. (Note to self: Watch demo dl's, etc.)

Overtime with a lot of exposure to good, bad and indifferent code we can start to learn subtleties and develop a toolbox of tricks.
Practice needs to be relaxed, stress free and playful so we can experiment. 



### Breakable Toys

Experience is built upon failure if not more than success. But we are often in an environment which does not allow for failure.

Thus we need to seek out bold tasks, to give ourselves opportunity to try and fail. Build your favorite thing, regardless of what it is as long as its fun to you, after all, if its a chore it will gather dust after the initial burst of enthusiasm.



### Reflect As you Work

Regular inspection of how you are working, are your practices novel, up to date?

If there's something pleasant or even unpleasant, ask how it got that way, if they are negative, how can it be improved?

The goal here is to extract the maximum amount of educational value by breaking down every experience and putting it back together.

A way this can be actionable is to write down the things you do and the connections between them, this is known as a Personal Practices Map.



### Record what you learn

It will become a vital resource for you to draw upon, and can act as a reminder when you forget. 

It will also help you meet like minded individuals whom may be able to help you in your journey.
