Presenting an analysis on data isn't simply about reading graphs and talking about insights.
Often times, presentations are cluttered with text or graphs, which can make it hard for the audience to extract the analysis.
It is during these times, which 'storytelling' is used. 

By using storytelling, one can create an engaging performance which will ensure the delivery of the main insights.

There are different types of data stories, which are clearly explained on Tableaus website (hyperlink this later https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/story_best_practices.htm)


Like the name suggests, storytelling implies a flow in which a story is told. We can expect something like:
1. The Plot. (Overarching point of the analysis)
2. Rising action (plot buildup - this can mean diving deeper into the cause of the main point)
3. Climax (Identifying the cause)
4. Falling action (Data on how we can learn/improve from the climax)
5. Ending (Conclusion, what we learnt and what actions we can take from the insights)
