Presenting an analysis on data isn't simply about reading graphs and talking about insights.
Often times, presentations are cluttered with text or graphs, which can make it hard for the audience to extract the analysis.
It is during these times, which 'storytelling' is used. 

By using storytelling, one can create an engaging performance which will ensure the delivery of the main insights.

There are different types of data stories, which are clearly explained on [Tableau's website](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/story_best_practices.htm). 
1. Change over time 
	- Use chronology to illustrate a trend. 
	- Discussion starts with why or why does it keep happening? What can we do to prevent this from happening?
2. Drill down
	- Sets context to better understand what is going on in a particular category.
	- Why is this place or thing different? How much are they different? How do they compare with others?
3. Zoom out
	- Describe how something your audience cares about relates to a bigger picture.
	- How does it relate? What effects do they have on one another?
4. Contrast
	- Show how two or more subjects different.
	- How do they differ? How can you make them perform similarly? What should we focus on?
5. Intersections
	- Highlight important shifts when one category takes over another.
	- What causes the shifts? Good or bad shifts? What effects do they imply/have?
6. Factors
	- Explains a subject by dividing it into types or categories.
	- Is there a particular category we should focus on more? How much does it affect the metric we care about?
7. Outliers
	- Show anomalies, where things are going wrong.
	- Why is this item different? What implications are there?

Additionally, like the name suggests, storytelling implies a flow in which a story is told. We can expect something like:
1. The Plot. (Overarching point of the analysis)
2. Rising action (Plot buildup - this can mean diving deeper into the cause of the main point)
3. Climax (Identifying the cause)
4. Falling action (Data on how we can learn/improve from the climax)
5. Ending (Conclusion, what we learnt and what actions we can take from the insights)

Of course, this is merely one recipe for storytelling and by no means should one restrict themselves to only this method.
I will include more methods as I discover them here.
