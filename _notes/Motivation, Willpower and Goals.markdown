title: Motivation, Willpower and Goals
permalink: /Notes/MW&G/

Often times people will set out to accomplish a task, goal or attempt to develop a habit for a healthier lifestyle. 
Most often than not however, people lose sight and become unproductive, unmotivated and become unable push onward. 
They will criticize themselves, labeling their situation as a slump, burnout, procrastination or even on the extreme levels, laziness. 

This is a cycle I'm sure many of us has experienced, and one I am seeking to change for good. 
Thus, I have decided to sit down and research productivity in an effort to better manage motivation and willpower.


_Disclaimer: This page is highly subjective and catered to my understanding of myself. 
Although this may still be helpful to you, consider these as ideas in which you can pick and choose to assist your own mindset._



## Motivation

Motivation is somewhat like a spiritual source of energy which can push you to do something you would otherwise avoid.

It comes in waves where the highs are high and the lows are low. In the end however, your motivation levels is mostly uncontrollable.

In the modern world where consistency is valued, sole reliance on motivation can be detrimental. We must find a way to continue even during periods of low motivation.


## Willpower

Willpower is simply the energy you have to do something you didn't want to do. It is what we use when we are unmotivated, but need to finish the day.
Personally, I like to think of willpower as fuel in a tank, it can be used and refilled, but is ultimately limited. So I guess the question now is, what happens when we are low on both willpower and motivation?

The answer is, not much. There's no third force we can rely on after motivation and willpower.
Instead, what we should do is ensure we refill our tank, optimize its usage and expand its capacity.
Here are a list of tips and tricks that I have found:

1. Find inspiration
	- Inspiration gathers dormant energy to help you feel more motivated to work which can give you a boost, but is not foolproof as ultimately seeking inspiration needs willpower in the first place
2. Remember why you are doing something
	- If you forget why you're doing something in the first place it will require more willpower to continue and you'll most likely stop. 
3. Minimize unimportant decisions
	- Keep energy from decision fatigue (energy loss from thinking/making too many decisions)
	- Steve Jobs wore the same outfit for a decade!
4. Eat breakfast & sleep well
	- Fruit and nuts are good slow burn foods which should keep energy levels up throughout the day
5. Step outside your comfort zone to expand capacity
	- This can be simple tasks like using your left hand, consciously changing speech habits to exclude 'umm' & 'like' or even performing burdensome activities
	- If you are running low on willpower doing this remember that similar to a workout, the last rep yields the most change
	- In line with this, a good rule of thumb is that if you don't feel like doing something, then you should probably do it. Eventually you will get used to being uncomfortable
6. Try pre-commitments
	- Pre-commit to doing something by promising yourself or a friend that you will do something. This will reduce the energy needed to start a task.
7. Prime your day
	- Start off orderly & make a habit of it, be productive in small things to hopefully ride the momentum rather than willpower throughout the day
8. Never say never to temptations
	- Tell yourself later rather than no. This will help put off temptations with less willpower
	- Alternatively make a if-then commitment. If a temptation happens, then this is how you will respond. 
9. Self monitor your productivity
	- Keeping a table or chart can help you realize faster when you're having an off week, in which you can take actions to combat it
10. Commit to the promises you make to yourself
	- If you follow through with decisions, it will help with all of the willpower things in general.
	
All these tricks can be overwhelming to take in at once, so we should plan it out.


## Goals

To put everything we've learnt to practice, we need to plan for it.
But before I touch on goals, I want to revisit why we started this journey in the first place.

Any time we're being unproductive and doing something we know we shouldn't be, deep in our minds, the activity we are participating in is what we actually consider most important.
We know in these situations, that our mind is wrong, so lets change our perception of importance. 

First, we break down why we like doing the other activity. Let us use games as an example.

Some reasons we like games over more important objectives could be:

1. Progress in video games is measurable. You obtain instant feedback and progress quickly.
2. There is an end goal. The next action or objective is clear.

Once we've identified why, replicate those aspects for everything else. 
Additionally, ensure that we know why we're doing it and what our end goal is. Make sure our "why" is enticing and something you care about. For example, rather than saying 'I want to become a good artist', say 'I want 1M followers on DeviantArt'.

Next, you won't be motivated if you don't believe that your goal is achievable. Thus, ensure that goal is achievable in a finite amount of time. Then, research the path towards that goal. Find others whom have trekked a similar path, learn what it takes and learn that a path exists. This way, you will not have this fear of impossibility.

Finally, write down the steps you personally plan to take and perhaps milestones along the way so that you feel real progress. Make the plans actionable and clear. 
A good extract I read uses Super Mario as an example: "In Super Mario the next step isn't to reach the end of the level. It is to get over this platform, or reach this power up. They are clear, and small."

This can ultimately be summarized into S.M.A.R.T goals.
Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Reasonable and Time constrained goals. Really plan it out and follow through.

Now, apply what we've learnt with willpower into our lives by making SMART goals and better ourselves for tomorrow.

Keep fighting.
