Hello, I am Jack. Welcome to my portfolio.

First, a little about myself. I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor of Computer Science in Data Science, Monash University. From then, I started with a suboptimal job search and when combined with Covid-19, I've put myself in a rather difficult position.

Thats where this portfolio comes in. Inspired by my friend Keddy, as a means to motivate myself, I have decided to record and store notes, personal projects and information here.

Over time, this portfolio of mine will be populated, and I hope one day to look back and be proud of the development I went through, regardless if it was personal or professional.

Feel free to look around, explore and learn with me.
